## Poetry for the Web

Do you have a text editor?  Then you can create web sites with minimal fuss!
**Verse** is a content-first site generator that lets you focus on your content,
without getting bogged down in the details of consistent navigation, page layout,
templating, etc.

## Flexible &amp; Static

With **Verse**, you start with a set of primitives for things like Pages,
Blog Posts, etc., and you assemble them however you like &mdash; pick your
URL scheme, design your template, choose your fonts and CSS, etc.

Then, author your content (as a set of YAML + markdown files), and let
**verse** generate your new website, all as static HTML.  No application
server process, nothing but regular old files you can server up with nginx.
